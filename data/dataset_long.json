I’ve already tried reinstalling it, clearing the cache, and restarting my device, but the issue persists. I’m using an iPhone 14 running iOS 17.2. I urgently need access to my account because I manage multiple team projects from the dashboard. Can you please look into this and let me know what steps I should take? Thanks, Jordan.",

    "text": "Hello, I recently upgraded to the Enterprise Plan, but I noticed that I was charged for both the Standard and the Enterprise plans in the same billing cycle. This seems like a billing error. I also want to ensure that the new invoice includes the correct VAT number for my company’s records. Please update the invoice and confirm if the extra charge will be refunded. Thank you. - Morgan",

I’d love to understand more about your bulk pricing options for teams with over 500 users, what onboarding support looks like, and how customization works for large-scale deployments. Do you offer dedicated account managers or implementation engineers? If you could send over a proposal or book a call this week, that would be awesome. Cheers, Danielle.",

Specifically, I’m wondering about data retention policies and third-party data sharing practices. Where can I find the archive of previous privacy policies? Also, do you have a DPA (Data Processing Agreement) template available for review? Thanks for your help! – Sam.",

I’ve tried it in Chrome, Safari, and Firefox. Can you please provide a valid password reset link or manually reset it on your end? Also, could you investigate whether this is affecting other users? It’s urgent as I’m locked out of my main workspace. Regards, Priya.",
